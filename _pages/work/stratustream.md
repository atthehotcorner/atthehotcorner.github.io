- Worked with a team building internal digital dashboards displaying statistics on product usage and call center
metrics, generated from incoming raw data
- Created front-end and user interface of dashboards that update in near real-time and responsive to any screen size
(React, Socket.io, Node.js Bootstrap, LESS, JS, HTML, and CSS)
- Integrated AWS services to process incoming raw data, store records, and host the product, at low operating cost
(Lambda, DynamoDB, Elastic Beanstalk)
