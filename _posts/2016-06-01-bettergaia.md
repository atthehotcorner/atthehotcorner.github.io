As a side project and hobby that I developed over the past few years since 2008, BetterGaia is a web browser extension that added tools for users for a particular social networking website named [Gaia Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_Online).

BetterGaia allowed users to socialize and interact with Gaia in a better way. At BetterGaia's peak in January 2015, over 14 thousand weekly users were logged according to Google's analytics tools.

BetterGaia was built with a tech stack of Chrome Platform APIs, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
