As an pitch developed in a Affective Computing course, I was tasked with my team to explore connecting learning with [affective computing](http://affect.media.mit.edu/). We came up with an Affective Mirror.

The Affective Mirror will help user learn how to achieve a “good night sleep” where users feel positive and energetic after waking up. It does this by taking various factors such as sleep time, meal time, and exercise during the day as features and train on affective recognition of users in the morning when they step in front of the mirror. It will use all of this data to find patterns in order to make suggestions to the user of how they can improve their future mornings.
