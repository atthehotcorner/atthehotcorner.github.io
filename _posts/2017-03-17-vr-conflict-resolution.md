As an pitch developed in a Affective Computing course, I was tasked with my team to explore connecting health and well-being with [affective computing](http://affect.media.mit.edu/). We came up with an Virtual Reality application that would help resolve misunderstandings between two people.

Everyone has had a conversation with someone and said something that was taken negatively by the other person. This misunderstanding can have lasting effects on relationships. *Ve aRe (VR) In Their Shoes* provides users with an opportunity to share their conversations with others in order to maintain healthier relationships.

Person A will have a BCI headset and a pair of camera glasses during a conversation with B. If user A feels offended by a conversation with user B and would like to inform B, A can simply share the conversation with B. B can now watch the conversation in VR from Aâ€™s perspective in order to more accurately understand how A was feeling. While watching, B will be presented with what emotions A was feeling throughout the conversation. B can later take actions to assist in solving the problem if necessary. Users can even share great conversations and memories in order to thank people for their advice if they resulted in feeling better after the conversation.
