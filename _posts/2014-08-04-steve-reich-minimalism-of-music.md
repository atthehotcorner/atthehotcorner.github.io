The following was a paper that written as a student during my undergrad studies. I decided to publish it here for others to discover, and perhaps learn from my own studies.

Steve Reich’s works on repetitive music in twentieth century allowed for the advancement of a new movement that was then revolutionary later to be known as minimalism. With its “repetitive, pulse-driven … slips and leaps of a lively mind” characteristics, Reich’s pieces explored new musical concepts and experimented with unusual sources of sound for the composition of music (Oxford Music Online). Reich’s philosophy on music creation transformed the conceptions of what music is by breaking the conventions of what was accepted as music and the sources that music can be composed from.

In his early years as a composer, Reich created music iconic for its use of human speech and repetition. His “claim to fame” works came from him physically experimenting with tape looping. Slight imperfections from two tape recorders going slightly out of sync from each other during playback eventually resulted in his works *It’s Gonna Rain* and *Come Out*. Both pieces built from interview from the urban Civil Rights Movement of New York City during the proved the method viable and the success from these works allowed Reich to jumpstart his adventure on discovering untraditional methods of crafting music (Hoek 7). The beauty of both tracks did not come from such characteristics as harmony, notes, or tone—but instead from the absence of them. This perspective created by Reich brought the idea of what made music “music”, into question.

By challenging the notions of music, he also allowed for musical influences from non-Western cultures to be introduced into Western music. For instance, Reich’s studies in African drumming brought him confusion at first. “I had heard African music but…I didn’t know how it was put together. So to see in notation overlapping rhythmic patterns put together so their down-beats do not coincide showed me a radical new way of making music” (Hoek 9). Incorporating ideas and elements from non-Western cultures into his works further pushed critics to call him out. Such critics dramatized the difference and change and labeled Reich as a minimalist, even though his music did not completely fit the ideas of minimalism

# Philosophy

Reich’s foundation of philosophy was shaped by the education he received while attending Cornell, Juilliard and Mills College. Secondary education was where the source of many of his successes such as the *It’s Gonna Rain* and *Come Out* originate from.

While studying at Mills College, Reich studied under Luciano Berio, a musician famed for his serial and electronic works in the 1960s. Berio’s focus on the twelve-note scale deterred and demotivated Reich, prompting his teacher to express to him “if you want to write tonal music, why don’t you write tonal music (Hoek 3)?" Berio’s statement is what helped turned Reich to discover a more different and distinct style, setting him apart from the trends of those days.

This contrasts with his experiences of his youth. Reich as a child rarely heard music from the twenty century, only being exposed to the commonplace traditional music made for the everyday gentlemen. His father believed that such sounds would help shape Reich into a civilized, cultured man. But as his parents separated and moved to opposing coasts of the United States, Reich found himself independent at the forefront of musical revolution in New York City. The popular culture there at the time established a unique cultural ideal and a set of values in his mind. Reich explored Jazz, Baroque, bebop, and all other forms found in the melting pot of the time, setting the foundation of his style and taste (Hoek 1).

Reich believes in only following one style of music, allowing for him to get in depth with the philosophies of his work. One can find meaning in his works, which he considers to be absent in composers that only mimic his style for the sake of its popularity. Responding to a question on the reasons for remaining constant to a single fashion of music, Reich responded:  

> Those composers—and there are some who should remain nameless—who join the style of the month club and have their ‘this piece’ and ‘that piece’ and so on, they sort of reach out to find what it is that will do the trick. I would submit that those people never do get it right. It’s not for lack of skill; it’s for lack of commitment. (Zuckerman)

Additionally, Reich composes music without any thought about catering to the audience, keeping his work pure and free of opinion. In an interview by the American Public Media in July of 2002, Reich stated “… it is enormously important to me that the audience likes the music. But the only way I’ve figured out how to do that is, if I love it [by myself], hopefully you’ll love it too” (Zuckerman).

Music is a playground for him, a place to experiment with new sounds from non-contemporary sources. Reich avoids traditional musical achievements. Further along in the same interview he made the following statement on his views on orchestra, “…I decided in 1987 that I would not write for orchestra again. As of this date, nothing has come along to make me rethink that decision” (Zuckerman). By shying away from the commonplace, Reich was able to succeed in gaining fame just by being different. Being unconventional allowed Reich to attract followers with only the aspect of oddity, since the perception of dissimilarity helped spur discussion of his works in various musical circles.

*Pendulum music*, a track found in the album *From the Kitchen Archives No. 2: Steve Reich and Musicians, Live 1977*, showcases a part of Reich’s playfulness and nonconformity. Using the sound interference feedback coming from loudspeakers and microphones in too close of contact to each other, Reich used the physics of repetitive pendulum motion to create a distinctive performance (Potter 174). The result is a musical piece more in tune to a performance of the visual arts that I would consider more of a “counter-culture” statement towards traditional classical music than rather a simple musical piece.

# Reaction

My personal philosophy on music is simply this: if it has a rhythm and listening to it is enjoyable, then it is music. Steve Reich’s ideas challenge the traditional boundaries of music, but still follows through with my own philosophy. These same ideas expand my way of thinking by broadening the range of potential sources of music.

Does music differ from sound? I believe so. Reich’s works include parts of our natural surroundings and clips from city life, but in more so objects not usually considered for its sound. It took his ingenuity to unite such sounds and form them into his critically acclaimed compositions. Even in his music where more contemporary instruments were used, the rhythm was sporadic, jarring and almost pattern-less. Reich’s experiments with sounds then unused in music from electric guitars and keyboards proved successful and inspiring, which these days are routinely found in pop music and considered exclusive to the genre (Potter 249).

Reich changed the expectations of music and music produced during his youth and adulthood and people started to emulate Reich and his works. In the 1980s, he started to notice that the youth was learning his pieces and could play them straight from their memory:

> Time is on your side, it turns out, as a composer. I don't know how old you were when you first heard my music, but you probably were fairly young … [these new performers] play a piece of mine called ‘Sextet’, which my group still reads off the notation, but these guys play it from memory. My mouth is hanging open. (Klein)

Part of this revelation is due to the fact that Reich trademark style was becoming everlasting. His philosophy seemed to be accepted in a sense by classic musical culture, and these days Reich is considered a pioneer in minimalism. By breaking down the conventional boundaries of music, Reich allowed for a new generation of performers to follow in his footsteps and explore his ideas in the same way.
