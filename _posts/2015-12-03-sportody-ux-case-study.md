As part of an User Experience and Design exercise, a team and I worked with a locally based company [Sportody](https://www.sportody.com/) in order to improve their website experience. Sportody is an outdoor sports network that allows users to discover activities to take part in.

I was tasked to locate weaknesses in the Sportody.com website user experience, and find ways to increase user engagement. This lead to conducting focus group studies on the current usability and user flow. From there, user stories, personas, and storyboards were created, and presented with interactive mockups of an improved website.

Through user research, we chose to focus on group interaction to increase engagement. It was common for research participants to comment on wanting a “group” type interaction. This group interaction can be having a group of close friends where they talk about adventures they want to go on, a group of experienced hikers in the area sharing their knowledge, or a group for strangers to share their adventures with other people to create a community around adventuring in an area.

We believed that groups would create this community that rewards people for their contribution to get them more likely to come back. As a user contributes more to the group, they will become a “Top Contributor” thus giving users the satisfaction of feeling important and included in a community.

This opportunity to work with Sportody was made possible by Dr. Lisa Anthony.
