As an pitch developed in a Affective Computing course, I was tasked with my team to explore improving relationships between people with [affective computing](http://affect.media.mit.edu/). We came up with a bear that would help improve the relationship between a parent and their child.

Divorce can be hard on children, especially when they’re very young and don’t completely understand what is going on. Parents during this time can also have difficulty balancing their situation and being there for their child if they’re needed. Care Bear would act as a relational agent that children 5 - 9 years of age can talk to and play with. Care Bear can speak with the child and try to cheer them up as well as inform parents and a therapist if human attention is needed. Care Bear could also be used to play with child and analyze this play scenario.

It would assist in bridging the gap between bickering parents and child as well as provide relevant information to a therapist to assist in treatment. We hope that Care Bear could assist in reducing the emotional neglect a child may feel during the time of their parents divorcing and be a lasting friend.
