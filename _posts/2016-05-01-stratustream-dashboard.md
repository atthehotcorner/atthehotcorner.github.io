I worked with a team for a year building a internal digital dashboard solution for a local Florida company [Info Tech](https://www.infotechfl.com/). These dashboards display statistics on product usage and call center metrics.

This internal digital dashboard solution overall converted raw business data into useful business analytics for Info Tech's products. I worked with the Head of Research and Development on how to implement and build out these dashboards.

Algorithms were implemented parsing incoming data from production systems to produce metrics. I designed the look of these dashboards to work across all screen sizes/resolutions, ensuring quality when viewed on phones, computers, and large custom displays (in the office). After design, I developed the front-end and user interface of dashboards, and had them update in near real-time with web sockets.

I worked with a tech stack of Amazon Web Services, React, JavaScript/Node.js, Socket.io, HTML, and CSS.

This opportunity to work with Info Tech was made possible by being a part of the University of Floridaâ€™s [Integrated Product and Process Design](http://www.ippd.ufl.edu/) program.
