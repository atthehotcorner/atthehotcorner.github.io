As part of a course about developing video games and artificial intelligence, a team and I worked on a game that would incorporate various AI and scripting patterns into a 3D side-scroller. In particular, I incorporated [A* *(A star)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), moving characters and enemies by finding the best optimal paths for them to take. Additionally, a player health system was implemented in order to create a combat system between the playable characters and enemy characters.

[Codename Sun](https://github.com/aue/CodenameSun) was developed with the [Unity game engine](https://unity3d.com/).
