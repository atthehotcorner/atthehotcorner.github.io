Senty is a Google Chrome Extension that shows you the tone of what you type into any text box on the web. By using an offline [sentiment module](https://github.com/thisandagain/sentiment) as a building block, Senty shows an aggregate score and the positive and negative terms that contribute to it as you type. As a tool, this can help communities communicate with a better understanding of the tonality and expression of their own words.

[Get Senty in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/senty/mldgljmaiciohfgkphpabhboeledejml).

## What's next for Senty
So much more-- including customization, a better scoring mechanism, and more insights into the data given.
