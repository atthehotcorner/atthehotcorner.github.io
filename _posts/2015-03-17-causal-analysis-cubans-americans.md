The following was a paper that written as a student during my undergrad studies. I decided to publish it here for others to discover, and perhaps learn from my own studies.

Cubans that reside in America are a subculture stemming from the Cuban culture and community. There is a renewed interest in Cuba itself, with headlines recently appearing in the news. While not only Cuban nor American, Cuban Americans in a whole form a subculture that differs from their heritage. The first generation of their families left the Caribbean island in hopes of a better life, but what reasons made them leave Cuban to come to America in the first place? How did they assimilate to both Cuban and American culture? And finally, what problems do they face after they settled down in America, even today? As a member and the current Secretary of the *Association of Cuban Student Engineers* at the University of Florida, and with connections to the *Cuban American Student Association* and the *Hispanic Student Association* at the University, I had a vast ocean of candidates to interview, research, and learn from.

# How did the Cubans residing in America subculture form?

The history of Cuba riddled is with political strife. With an off-chance encounter at *La Casita*, The Institute of Hispanic-Latino Cultures, I was able hold an in-depth discussion with Ms. Mendez. Having immigrated to the United States in 2004, Mendez today is a history major and board member of the *Hispanic Student Association* here at the University. The following was her knowledge on the subject, gained through her time she personally lived on the island and the studies her major has taken her through:

The Cuban culture residing in America formed as a result of the Cuban Diaspora that began after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. After the triumph of the revolutionary government, different sectors of Cuban society fled the island for various reasons. The majority of the first group of exiles that left right after 1959, fled in order to escape the newly formed communist state. This group was part of the upper and middle class in Cuba, and they were placed at a disadvantageous situation with the new political system. A very famous example is the *Peter Pan Operation*, where many upper and middles class Cuban families sent their children to the United States so they could escape the communist regime.

Throughout the decades, the regime underwent a period of consolidation where new social, political, and economic systems were set in place. This led to another wave of migration in the 1980s as a result of strong political repression against dissidents, or anyone that the state targeted as ‘enemy of the state’. This group of people was made up of intellectuals, artist, and musicians, who fled to Mexico and the United States.

Another important wave of migration took place right after the fall of the USSR in 1991. Cuba underwent a period of economic stagnation, which resulted in an event called ‘El Mariel’. Many of the Cuban Americans in Miami today are part of a generation that arrived to the US before 1990.

After such an extensive recount, I decided to investigate myself.

## Past History

The path that led to the formation of a Cuban American subculture was easily traced back in history. After turning to journals published in the past two decades, I was able to form a consensus on the question. Stemming from the 1960s and the rise of the Cuban revolution, the exodus of Cubans fleeing from their motherland into America led to the formation of Cubans Americans, as recounted by Ms. Mendez. As the decades progressed, and with the United States blocking formal diplomatic relations for nearly half a century, this subculture has developed independently from Cuban culture. Listed on the United States’ list of state sponsors of terrorism, Cuba is a politically contested subject to discuss, a view shared by many Cuban Americans that I have encountered. This leads to alienation when people come into contact with this subculture. But with the differing ideologies and lifestyle that America has been able to offer, a greater percentage of people such as Mendez have been able to do what they never could have done back in Cuba, but sacrificed much of their personal identities in order to do so.

## Restriction

Even when Cuban Americans settle into America and its culture, they were unable to return to the nation due to travel restrictions enacted by the United States, which limits the ability to travel to Cuba. With family and friends left behind, the Cuban American subculture formed with others that found themselves in the exact same situation. With enclaves found in New York, New Jersey, and Miami, the Cuban American subculture was able to retain most of their cultural norms and customs, especially their variety of Spanish. Ms. Mendez left the nation at the age of nine, and left behind her grandfather and cousins. But with the familiarity of the Cuban Americans in Miami and how close they felt back to home in Cuba for Mendez, she was able to make the transition well. This allowed her to continue to identify as Cuban, as mentioned by Mendez. After the initial shock, these established enclaves allowed for Cuban Americans to capitalize on economic opportunities that led to a rise in their well-being (Nijman, 1997).

# What issues do Cuban Americans face today?

Successive generations of Cuban Americans have taken root into American society, but the lack of Cuban culture in America has eroded the cultural norms and customs that their parents and grandparents took part in Cuba, impacting the loss of their Cuban identity.

To investigate, I spoke to Mr. Rey, the current president of the *Association of Cuban Student Engineers*. A child of well-educated Cuban immigrates, Rey was born and raised in Miami, before he attended the University of Florida. Growing up, Rey was surrounded by the Miami Cuban culture, immersed with other immigrates and youth that were in the same position as him. But as his grade school education here in the United States started, he started to falter in recalling words in Spanish while his English vocabulary grew. By the time Rey started high school as a teenager, he recognized the necessity of restoring his Spanish, and encountered difficulty in grasping the syntax and grammar rules he once knew in his Spanish studies. I questioned Rey why he did not give up on learning Spanish, where he replied, “A knowledge of Spanish is essential. Knowing multiple languages allows you the opportunities to meet many more people, and have access to their ideas.”

## State of a Language

With Mr. Rey’s quest to stay bilingual, I decided to research the issue of learning Spanish in this Cuban American culture. A majority of the subculture happens to be bilingual, but in some enclaves a part stay monolingual, as the predominance of Spanish speakers affords them no need to learn English. Meanwhile, second and later generational Cuban Americans typically become bilingual speakers in Spanish and English. The children of first-generational Cuban Americans find themselves placed in between living an American lifestyle while taught Cuban customs at home. With neglect, they usually only will learn a percentage of Spanish, which happened to transpire with Mr. Rey. It has been found that simplification of Spanish has occurred, and these children will generally only learn the amount of Spanish that is passed down through their family in their childhood years (Lynch, 1999).  

## Loss of a Bond

The loss of their language is the loss of a gateway into Cuban American culture. Due to informal education on the Cuban variety of Spanish language, people in this subculture lose an integral close-knit communal bond towards other Cuban Americans and Cubans outright. According to Mr. Rey, after spending his entire life in America, his own desire to visit Cuba was nearly nonexistent. Many younger peers like Rey face the issue of using English outside the home with others and reserving Spanish at home for family and friends. While widespread decline of Spanish from the subculture has not yet occurred, following generations of Cuban Americans may find themselves further divided from their heritage, as they find fewer opportunities to communicate in Spanish.

In remark, the first generation of Cubans that reside in America left the Caribbean island in hopes of a better life. But the toll on assimilating to both Cuban and American culture has had its advantages and disadvantages. The path that led to the formation of a Cuban American subculture is easily traced in history, though Ms. Mendez’s knowledge of waves of immigrates wanting to leave the communist country. After the initial shock of coming to America, established enclaves allowed for Cuban Americans to capitalize on economic opportunities that led to a rise in their well-being, but also led to losses of cultural norms and customs of Cuban culture. These losses are prevalent in this subculture’s descendants, as they form their own identity.
